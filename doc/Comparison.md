# Comparisons

It turns out the desire to do everything in your text editor is apparently a very common mental illness. After mostly writing this plugin I googled "Vim Workflowy" and found a number of similar products. How they compare to VimOutline is documented here:

## Vimflowy

I had planned to name this plugin vimflowy before discovering this (website)[https://www.wuthejeff.com/vimflowy]. The main difference is it runs in the browser and doesn't operatore on plaintext. Whether this is an upside or downside is a matter of taste. Some other Pro/Cons:

Pro
* A cleaner more fully featured product

Con
* Can't use it with Vim Plugins or your vimrc

## Workflowish

This is a very similar plugin to this one.

Pro
* Better integrated with vim folds
Con
* Doesn't hide indentation as you focus
* Not as well documented

## VimOutliner

This is distinct from Workflowy in that it's not designed for fractal outlines. You can't treat any node as it's own head. That says it has a lot of fun features not implemented here:
* Checkboxes
* Fun colors
* Date and time inclusion
Though it's the opinion of this plugin's author that datetime help should be managed by a snippets plugin.
